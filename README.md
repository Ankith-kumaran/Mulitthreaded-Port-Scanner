# Overview

A Port Scanner is an application or a method to determine which ports on a particular network are open. 
In layman terms, it is basically a person knocking on doors to check if someone is home.
There are many reasons why a port scanner is implemented; running a port scan on a network/server reveals which ports are open and available to receive(listen state), 
as well as revealing the presence of security devices such as firewalls that are present between the sender and the target. This process is called fingerprinting. 
This process is used to check for and expose vulnerabilities in a networkâ€™s security system.
It is employed in most networking systems as a countermeasure to malicious attacks.
